## Contributing Bug Fixes
Bug reports and fixes are welcome - we want this to be as stable as possible.

## Contributing Features
We welcome feature suggestions and contributions. Both will require a CLA to be signed and some legal paperwork taken care of (see following sections). We'll be focusing first on some minor refactoring and documentation, so features will be somewhat lower priority for a short while. The intent of this codebase is to provide a example/template for others to build off of, so features or code changes which are drastically outside the scope of intent should probably be in a separate branch.

## Legal
You will need to complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Briefly, this agreement testifies that you are granting us permission to use the submitted change according to the terms of the project's license, and that the work being submitted is under appropriate copyright.

Please submit a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before submitting a pull request. Download the agreement ([Microsoft Contribution License Agreement.docx](Microsoft-Contribution-License-Agreement.docx) or [Microsoft Contribution License Agreement.pdf](Microsoft-Contribution-License-Agreement.pdf)), sign, scan, and email it back to <cla@microsoft.com>. Be sure to include your github user name along with the agreement. Once we have received the signed CLA, we'll review the request. Please note that we're currently only accepting pull requests of bug fixes rather than new features.

## Why we ask for a Contributor License Agreement
Microsoft asks that all contributors agree to a contributor license agreement (CLA). CLAs are generally common and accepted in most open source software projects. We all want Microsoft’s open source projects to be as widely used and distributed as possible. We also want its users to be confident about the origins and continuing existence of the code. The CLA help us achieve that goal by ensuring that we have the agreement of our contributors to use their work, whether it be code, or documentation.

Microsoft to distribute your code without restriction. It doesn’t require you to assign to us any copyright you have, the ownership of the copyright remains with you. You cannot withdraw permission for use of the contribution at a later date. 

We are generally seeking originally authored code and documentation as contributions. Should you wish to submit materials that are not your original work, you may submit them separately to the Project in accordance with the terms of the CLA.

## Contributions which don't need the CLA
Major code contributions are the major area of contribution where we'll need the CLA signed. The following don't need the same red-tape.

* Descriptive Bug Requests (without code)
* Code used for reproduction of bugs (ie not intended for inclusion into the project)
* High-level feedback or feature requests
